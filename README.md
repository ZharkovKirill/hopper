# Two-dimensional one-legged hopping machine

 This repository contains a model of Reibert's hopping machine made using SimScape. 
 Also contains reference articles. The design of the robot repeats the robot from the article by **TSMC**.
 
Structurally, the system consists of:
- Flight controller
- Controller stance
